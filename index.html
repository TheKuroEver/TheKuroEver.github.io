                <p class="text-plate">Hi! My name is Mariusz, and I'm a second-year Mathematics student at University College London, expecting to graduate in 2025. My interests lie in Software and
                    Game development, and Machine learning. After graduating, I'd like to pursure a master's degree in Computer Science or Artificial Intelligence.</p>
                <p class="text-plate">In my spare time I like to play video games, skate, and work on my personal coding projects.</p>
                <p class="text-plate">Welcome to my website, which is currently unfinished! This is my first ever web project, made with just plain HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with a little JQuery here and there.</p>
                <p class="text-plate">Here you can find my projects, resume, and any future sites I make.</p>
                <p class="text-plate">This site is quite plain as I plan to build another using Flask which should be easier to maintain. At that point, there will be a link to that site here.</p>
