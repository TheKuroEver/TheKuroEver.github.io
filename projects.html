                <p class="text-plate"><a href="https://keeptalkinggame.com" target="_blank">Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes</a> (KTaNE) is a multiplayer co-op game developed by Steel Crate Games
                    about defusing bombs. This is done by solving so-called "modules" which are effectively these small interactive puzzles. The modules that come with the base game include Morse
                    Code, Maze, and Simon Says.</p>
                <p class="text-plate">There is a small but active modding community surrounding the game, who contribute modded modules for others to play. These modules are made using the Unity game
                    engine with the C# language. I have made several modded modules of my own, most notably Procedural Maze (top) and Orientation Hypercube (bottom).</p>
                <p class="text-plate">Procedural Maze simulates a maze whose walls are generated procedurally based on where the player moves and the current seed, which changes when new walls are
                    generated. The most challenging part of the implementation process was making sure the maze was always able to be solved, since the procedural nature of the maze makes it possible
                    for the player to trap themselves. To do this, I implemented depth-first-search-approach algorithm to attempt solve the maze on generation, and regenerate if unable.</p>
                <p class="text-plate">The goal of Orientation Hypercube is to apply rotations to a 4-dimensional hypercube such that it ends up in a target orientation. The most challenging part of
                    the making of this module was creating dynamic meshes to render the 3-dimensional 'faces' of the hypercube. As with Procedural Maze, this module has an autosolver which tries to
                    solve the module in a reasonable amount of moves. In the GIF, it took 11 moves.</p>
